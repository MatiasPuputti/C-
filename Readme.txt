Here i have projects that i have made in school and in my freetime.

They are in made with Microsoft visual studio 2017 and should have the original project folder structure.
I have compressed the folders, and they can be  extracted for example with 7-Zip.

If you just want to try and run these programs, i have compiled the projects and placed them in the Builds -folder, 
and named them based on the project folder they are pulled from.

Projects made for school courses:
Teht1-4
NoppaPeli
Palindromi_harj


Projects made in free time:
Kansioden_koko			(To get steam folder size faster.)
String_match_checker		(Simple console program that i made for comparing check sums against one another.)
